Things I haven't done yet:

Shards/Bonus Shards:

Soul Shard:
-Pickup FX (I'll probably be buying the advanced magic FX pack for that)
-Accurate shard material
-Shard rotation animation
-Tablet has some purple vignette when a shard is collected

Reveal Shard:
-Same things as the soul shard
-Enemies revealed overlay (I've finished it, but it could be tweaked)
-Bonus shard collect rumble (I've made it, but it could do with teaking)

Stun Orb:
-Stun orb collect shockwave
-The same shard pickup FX

I'll add more to the list soon, there's also things concerning the powers
