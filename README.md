Things I haven't done yet:

Shards/Bonus Shards:

Soul Shard:

-Pickup FX (I'll probably be buying the advanced magic FX pack for that)

-Accurate shard material

-Shard rotation animation

-Tablet has some purple vignette when a shard is collected

Reveal Shard:

-Same things as the soul shard

-Enemies revealed overlay (I've finished it, but it could be tweaked)

-Bonus shard collect rumble (I've made it, but it could do with teaking)

Stun Orb:

-Stun orb collect shockwave

-The same shard pickup FX


Powers:

Speed Boost:

-Red vignette

-Speed lines

Teleport:

-Pretty much the whole thing, this is a tricky one for me:

-Teleport function

-Teleport FX (FX pack)

-Teleport transition (FOV change)

Telepathy:

-Slight rumble

-Locating enemies

-Finding out how to recreate the material (cloud or outline)

-Using that to make the power

Primal Fear:

-Make all enemies in a certain radius stunned

-Large shake (maybe the same as the bonus shard)

-Making the shockwave (maybe the same one as the stun orb)

Telekinesis:

I've made a workable version of it (although it has a bug. If it collects no shards, it'll be permenantly broken

Vanish:

-Make yourself invisible and inaudible (so enemies can't see you), but you can still get killed by them

-Make the purple flash when you use vanish

-Make the vanish vignette border (it seems to move around unlike the other ones)

The Tablet:

-Make the power cooldown (visually)

-Finalize the tablet materials

General:

Pause Menu-I don't think there's much here, except for making the options, that'll be difficult

Shard Streak:

-Make it so when you collect a certain amount of shards, you get a streak, and the more shards you get, the higher the streak

-Set an enum for the shard streak to use in the ranking system later (will be made at the end)

-Make sure the ranking system will only get set higher then the last one

-When you die, your shard streak will reset, but not the enum

Ranking system-Will be done way later down the line, no need to worry about it now

I think that's all of it, but let me know if I've missed something
